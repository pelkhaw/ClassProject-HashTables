# ClassProject-HashTables
This project was about developing and implementing a hash table. Included are the options to use three different types of hash algorithms to deal with collision resolution. 

The drivers located in lab7.c where provided by the professor to create a standard input for our functions to use as an input for the hash table.

IMPORTANT: The project was designed to prove that hash algorithms only work with certain table sizes. So if the user selects double hashing they must also include a table size M that’s prime, for example ‘ –m 65537’. However if a Quadratic hashing is used the number must be a power of two so ‘-m 65536’ could be used for example. If the table size is incorrect the algorithms will be really inefficient or may crash. 

Options for the command line are located bellow
